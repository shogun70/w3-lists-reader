<h1>W3C Public Mailing Lists Reader</h1>

<p>This site is a snapshot of a few public mailing lists hosted by the W3C.
On modern browsers it also provides an enhanced viewing mode.</p>

<p>You can enter the lists on the local server at <a href="/Archives/Public/">/Archives/Public/</a>.</p>

<p>The canonical lists are at <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/</a></p>

<h2>Browser support</h2>

<p>Older and noscript browsers get a basic view (a bit like Reader Mode). 
Contemporary browsers have an enhanced view - 
it seems ok when I've tested on real machines in Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Safari,
but I have noticed a few failures in Safari and Edge when testing in BrowserStack.</p>

<p>You can always append <code>?no_boot</code> to the URL of any page to see the basic view for that page. 
It would be better if the UI offered the user the chance to revert to basic view.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>(If you look at the code you will think it is a big-ball-of-mud, 
but there is an element of design underneath it all.)</p>

<h3>Front end</h3>

<p>The front-end is fairly simple.</p>

<ul>
<li>When the landing-page loads, a trivial inline script checks 
if this is a contemporary browser.</li>
<li>If it is then it kicks off the enhancement process.</li>
<li>The enhanced view is three panes where each is populated with content coming from 

<ol>
<li>the list of mailing-lists</li>
<li>the index of a particular mailing-list</li>
<li>the message the user has selected to view</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If the landing-page is #1 then the other two aren't initially loaded.
Likewise, if it is #2 then pane #3 is initially empty.</li>
<li>After this the front-end just has to intercept navigation requests triggered 
when the user activates a hyperlink. 
Instead of reloading the page the response is processed and 
inserted in the appropriate pane. (Like frameset only evolved).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Back-end</h3>

<p>Because the enhanced view is composed in the browser 
the back-end is just a bit more than a mirror.
The "trickiest" part is that the separate mailing lists
the origin site - <a href="https://lists.w3.org">https://lists.w3.org</a> -
split messages up into periods but don't directly link between periods.</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>At installation it does a bit of intelligent spidering 
to build databases of periods and pages and 
to find the crosslinks between periods and also likely thread-starter messages.
This spidering also starts to build up a local cache so some requests 
won't need to be forwarded to the origin server.</p>

<ul>
<li>The list of lists page (/Archives/Public/) is reduced to 
a smaller list of interesting (and short) mailing lists</li>
<li>For each mailing list

<ul>
<li>The main index (/Archives/Public/<list>/) is read to identify calendar periods 
that actually have content</li>
<li>The thread sorted index for each period 
(/Archives/Public/<list>/<period>/thread.html) 
is read to identify contempory roots of threads</li>
<li>Contemporary root messages that also have a subject starting with "RE:" 
are loaded to check whether they reply to a message in the same list
but from an earlier period. This requires a 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/mid/">Message ID Resolver</a>.</li>
<li>If it does then the messages are added to each-others records in the database.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>File serving</h4>

<p>(Like I said - almost a mirror-site).</p>

<ul>
<li>All pages served by the site are merely transformed versions of those on the origin.</li>
<li>The installation spidering enters almost all the index pages into the local cache.
Most message pages are fetched the first time a user requests them.</li>
<li>The list of lists page is generated from the database with php rendering.</li>
<li><p>For each mailing list</p>

<ul>
<li>The main index is generated from the database as a table of months against years
(Again php-rendering)</li>
<li>The date sorted indexes are fetched as requested and transformed with XSLT.</li>
<li>The new threads indexes are generated from the data base with php rendering.</li>
<li>Message pages are fetched as requested and scraped and crosslinked 
(if appropriate) and the resultant content and metadata, etc 
is rendered with php.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>When any page is rendered the result is stored on the filesystem
so future requests are just serving static files.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools and Libraries</h3>

<ul>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Slim Framework</li>
<li>Guzzle HTTP</li>
<li>Monolog</li>
<li>HyperFrameset</li>
</ul>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>(So many things)</p>

<ul>
<li>Some messages on the origin have character-sets other than UTF-8 but we always 
pretend it is UTF-8. So much for being a smart mirror.</li>
<li>If the landing-page is a message then the appropriate list is loaded into the 
thread-pane but the focus in the thread-pane should then move to the line that
matches the message.</li>
<li>Some messages have really long lines and are not wrapped in the message-pane.</li>
<li>The CSS for individual pages and the enhanced view were implemented completely ad hoc.</li>
<li>The user may want to hide/show the left and top panes - 
add some toggle icons to the banner bar.</li>
<li>On small screens the left and top panes should be hidden by default 
and shown as overlays if the user enables them</li>
<li>Keep author and date in columns aligned to the right</li>
<li>In the threads pane a message may have an expander arrow (indicating it has replies)
but toggling it reveals (eventually) there are no replies. 
(The spidering is not intelligent enough)</li>
<li>When all three panes have content and you click in the left pane to load a different 
list then the message pane stays with the old message.</li>
<li>When navigating using the back and forwards button 
the threads pane can get out of sync.</li>
</ul>
