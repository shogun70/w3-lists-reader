      <h2>
        Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
        The HTMLFrameset model is the starting point for the design of
        HyperFrameset. This model has been evolved in the following important
        ways.
      </p>
      <h3>
        The frameset document is like a super-stylesheet
      </h3>
      <p>
        With HTMLFramesets the browser must first open the frameset document
        which in turn loads primary and auxiliary content in frames. This has
        the undesirable consequence that the URL in the address-bar doesn't
        match the URL of the primary content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <small><strong>This will also be the case with more flexible
        HTMLFrameset-like sites that rely on <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>
        instead of <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code>.</strong></small>
      </p>
      <p>
        With HyperFrameset, when the browser visits a landing-page the
        appropriate frameset document is loaded and <em>applied</em> via AJAX,
        with the landing-page content inserted into its appropriate frame and
        auxiliary content loaded into frames as defined by the frameset.
        Hyperlink navigation within the same site is managed by AJAX and
        history.pushState, so the URL in the address-bar automatically matches
        the URL of the primary content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A frameset document is similar to an external stylesheet in that it
            can be shared between several pages. It may even be referenced with
            a resource link in the content page, just like stylesheets:
          </p>
          <pre><code class=
          "html">&lt;link rel="frameset" type="text/html" href="frameset.html" /&gt;
</code></pre>
          <p>
            <small><strong>(This referencing method depends on the
            configuration. Scripted frameset lookup is
            preferred.)</strong></small>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The frameset document is still HTML
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Framed documents are <strong>content-only</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        HTMLFramesets foster a site and page design where the content of
        individual pages is the primary content that matches the page URL
        <strong>and no other content</strong>. But because HTMLFrameset frames
        create a new browsing context they allow each page to be scripted and
        styled in isolation from the containing frameset.
      </p>
      <p>
        The HyperFrameset model does not provide this scripting and styling
        isolation and more-over it considers that the primary content of a page
        is the only aspect of relevance to the frameset view. For this reason
        scripts and stylesheets are stripped from content pages before they are
        inserted into the frameset view.
      </p>
      <h3>
        The frameset document supports custom-elements
      </h3>
      <p>
        With HTMLFramesets, <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code> elements provide
        layout, splitting a region into either rows or columns of
        <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code>s or <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        In HyperFrameset frames and layout are implemented as custom-elements.
        The equivalent elements are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code>: <code>&lt;hf-frame&gt;</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>&lt;frameset cols=""&gt;</code>:
          <code>&lt;hf-hlayout&gt;</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>&lt;frameset rows=""&gt;</code>:
          <code>&lt;hf-vlayout&gt;</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        HyperFrameset implements other layout elements to allow more complex
        layout. Additional custom-elements can be defined if appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Content documents SHOULD NOT contain
        custom-elements!!</strong><br />
        If you want your content to make use of custom-elements then transform
        it before it is inserted into the view.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Frames are seamless
      </h3>
      <p>
        HyperFrameset frames don't create a new browsing context with
        <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, so their
        content automatically inherits styles from their including context.
        This means that styling for all framed content is provided by the
        frameset document, as you would expect from a super-stylesheet.
      </p>
      <p>
        HyperFrameset frames are declared with markup like
      </p>
      <pre><code class="html">&lt;hf-frame src="..."&gt;&lt;/hf-frame&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>
        so they look like HTMLIFrames, but don't imply a new browsing context.
        This also means that frames are <em>light-weight</em> - use as many
        frames as necessary to simplify implementation of your site.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Frames can have different presentations for different states.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Since HyperFrameset is implemented with AJAX it has complete control of
        frame presentation, whether the frame is <code>blank</code>,
        <code>loading</code> or <code>loaded</code>. The frameset can define
        appropriate presentation with conditional frame bodies, such as
      </p>
      <pre><code class="html">&lt;hf-frame&gt;
    &lt;hf-body condition="loaded"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/hf-body&gt;
    &lt;hf-body condition="loading"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/hf-body&gt;
    &lt;hf-body condition="blank"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/hf-body&gt;
&lt;/hf-frame&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>
        Control over frame presentation can also be extended to effects for
        page transitions, when a frame unloads content from one URL and loads
        content from the next URL. (Transition effects have not been
        implemented yet)
      </p>
      <h3>
        Framed documents can be transformed
      </h3>
      <p>
        A page that is being viewed standalone - perhaps because JS is disabled
        or failed, or the browser is out-of-date - will benefit from a basic
        stylesheet and some basic site navigation and auxiliary content.
        HyperFrameset will strip the stylesheet and has some basic ability to
        crop the primary content of the page, but what if the structure of the
        content when displayed in the frameset needs to be significantly
        different to that in the standalone case?
      </p>
      <p>
        HyperFrameset provides the capability of HTML-to-HTML transformation of
        content pages through script or templating. The defining markup for
        transformation might look like
      </p>
      <pre><code class="html">&lt;hf-frame&gt;
    &lt;hf-body&gt;
        &lt;hf-transform type="script"&gt;
            &lt;script for&gt;
            ({
                transform: function(content) {
                    ...
                }
            })
            &lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;/hf-transform&gt;
    &lt;/hf-body&gt;
&lt;/hf-frame&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>
        NOTE: Transformations facilitate dynamic declaration of
        <code>&lt;hf-frame&gt;</code>s.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Targets for hyperlinks are scriptable
      </h3>
      <p>
        With HTMLFramesets the target frame for a hyperlink in any particular
        frame is (by default) obtained from the <code>target</code> attribute
        on the hyperlink itself. This requires the framed document to have an
        understanding of the structure of the frameset in which it is placed.
      </p>
      <p>
        With HyperFrameset the target frame is obtained from a callback
        function defined in <em>the frameset document</em>.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Frameset documents are definitions
      </h3>
      <p>
        With HTMLFramesets the frameset document is a <em>declaration</em> of
        browser presentation, and there will be a one-to-one mapping of
        HTMLFrames in the view and <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code> declarations in
        the frameset document.
      </p>
      <p>
        With HyperFrameset the frameset document is a <em>definition</em> of
        browser presentation, and any <code>&lt;hf-frame&gt;</code> in the
        frameset document could be <em>both</em> a declaration of a frame
        instance in the view <em>and</em> a definition for other frame
        instances.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purpose of illustration: A frame <em>definition</em> would have
        both a frame-body (without which it doesn't define anything) and a
        definition ID (so it can be referenced). For example
      </p>
      <pre><code class="html">&lt;hf-frame defid="hf_frame1"&gt;
    &lt;hf-body&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/hf-body&gt;
&lt;/hf-frame&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>
        A frame <em>declaration</em> (which isn't also a definition) would have
        no body and would reference a frame definition by definition ID. For
        example
      </p>
      <pre><code class="html">&lt;hf-frame def="hf_frame1"&gt;&lt;/hf-frame&gt;
</code></pre>
      <h3>
        Nested frames
      </h3>
      <p>
        With HTMLFramesets, <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code> elements are nestable
        as long as they are a child of a <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        With HyperFrameset, a <code>&lt;hf-frame&gt;</code> is arbitrarily
        nestable inside another <code>&lt;hf-frame&gt;</code>. When this is
        combined with document transformation it makes dynamically loaded
        hierarchical-menus and directory-trees trivial, for example
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            the frameset document has a <code>&lt;hf-frame&gt;</code> that
            sources a master page which contains hyperlinks to sections of the
            site. The <code>&lt;hf-frame&gt;</code> defines a transform which
            processes some of those hyperlinks into
            <code>&lt;hf-frame&gt;</code>s which are in turn loaded into the
            view.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            a directory tree is split into several files, each containg one
            sub-directory. A navigation section in the frameset has a
            <code>&lt;hf-frame&gt;</code> that sources the top level file of
            the directory tree. The <code>&lt;hf-frame&gt;</code> also defines
            a transform which converts sub-directory hyperlinks into
            <code>&lt;hf-frame&gt;</code>s that source the sub-directory and
            apply the <em>same transform</em> as for the root directory.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </main>
