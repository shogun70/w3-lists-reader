        An important goal of HyperFrameset is to facilitate really-simple
        site-layouts and content-pages that are fully functional <strong>even
        if</strong> HyperFrameset fails to run. These best-practices are for
        making your site and pages fully usable (even if a little ugly) in all
        browsers (even older ones) without HyperFrameset.
      </p>
      <p>
        <small><strong>HyperFrameset can be used for a whole site, or for a
        section within a site (say a documentation set). In the following,
        "site" can also refer to a section within a site.</strong></small>
      </p>
      <p>
        A general reminder when developing a site is to stop adding stuff to
        individual pages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>don't add site navigation or contact forms to pages - they need
        their own page
        </li>
        <li>don't add placeholder tags to pages
        </li>
        <li>don't add presentation classes to elements
        </li>
        <li>don't add inline styles to elements
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Site Design
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>HINT:</strong> Think <a href=
        "http://thinkbda.com/journal/the-long-web/">API first</a>, HTML
        payload.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Site navigation (or a Table-of-Contents) is a resource. It should
        have its own page.
        </li>
        <li>Anything requiring a form submission is a resource. It should have
        its own page.
        </li>
        <li>You should be able to (eventually) navigate to any resource by
        starting at the home page (or Table-of-Contents page).
        </li>
        <li>If every page has a link to the home page then you can navigate
        (eventually) from any entry point to any other resource.
        </li>
        <li>Don't forget Search Engine Optimization. (<strong>TODO:</strong>
        expand on this)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A reasonable illustration of a simple site is the <a href=
        "http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/">GNU make
        manual</a>. - The table-of-contents has its own URL - Each page
        contains only primary content and some minimal contextual links -
        Contents / Index / Up / Previous / Next - There is (nearly) no inline
        styling - If you remove all styling it is still readable
      </p>
      <h3>
        Page Design
      </h3>
      <p>
        To work with HyperFrameset, an individual page only needs to contain
        the primary content for its URL.
      </p>
      <p>
        But sometimes HyperFrameset will not be able to apply the frameset
        document to the page. This can occur because
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Javascript is disabled
        </li>
        <li>HyperFrameset does not support the browser
        </li>
        <li>the HyperFrameset script failed to download
        </li>
        <li>HyperFrameset is configured to NOT start
        </li>
        <li>the frameset document failed to download
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this scenario you would like the content-page to have some auxiliary
        content and basic styling - something that can be dispensed with if
        HyperFrameset takes over.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Auxiliary content
      </h4>
      <p>
        Any landing-page content that isn't referenced by the frameset document
        will be removed from the page when the frameset is applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RECOMMENDATIONS:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Wrap the <em>primary content</em> of content pages in a
            <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;div role="main"&gt;</code>
            element. The default processing of content pages (a
            <code>&lt;hf-frame&gt;</code> with no
            <code>&lt;hf-transform&gt;</code>) is to crop to this "main"
            element (or the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> if this element isn't
            found).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add a short navigation section near the top of the
            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> using <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> or
            <code>&lt;div role="navigation"&gt;</code>. Include hyperlinks to
            the site-home, parent-directories of the page, and next and
            previous pages as appropriate.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (<strong>TODO:</strong> point to some demo markup. Mention appropriate
        hyperlinks and how they can be used in scoping)
      </p>
      <h4>
        Stylesheets
      </h4>
      <p>
        All <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code> or
        <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements in the content page will be removed
        when the frameset document is applied, so you can use them for fallback
        presentation without worrying about clashes with styling provided by
        the frameset document.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RECOMMENDATIONS:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use one external stylesheet - it can be updated without
            regenerating the page
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use simple styling that would be supported even on old browsers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A single column design is easier to implement and is more likely to
            be compatible with older browsers.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>WARNING:</strong> Inline styles are not removed by
        HyperFrameset and SHOULD NOT be used in content pages.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Scripts
      </h4>
      <p>
        Scripts in content pages are NEVER run by HyperFrameset so they COULD
        be used for fallback actions. If HyperFrameset does apply
        <strong>and</strong> <code>capturing</code> of the landing-page is
        enabled, then scripts in the landing page are disabled anyway. However,
        if HyperFrameset does apply but <code>capturing</code> is not enabled,
        then there is a potential clash between the actions of the landing page
        scripts and HyperFrameset processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RECOMMENDATIONS:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Content-pages do not need and SHOULD NOT have scripts, even for
        fallback.
        </li>
      </ul>
